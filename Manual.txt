If you see this file you are probabily using wrong Genai Dataset Generator app.
Here are NECESSARY steps to follow for a correct use:
1. Upload a folder only containing images.
2. Insert a keyword token.
3. If displayed, wait until file box's countdown ends

If you follow this steps and Manual continues to be the generated dataset, there could be a problem with image captioning Model.
If '[PREP]' log message display 'GUI Initialization done.', there are no errors related to Model and problems can be related to uploaded folder.
